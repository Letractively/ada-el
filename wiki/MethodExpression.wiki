#summary Method Expression

= Introduction =

A method expression represents a method to be executed on an object.
The valid syntax for the method expression is a subset of the EL expression.
Method expressions are used in JSF to bind an action or an event to an object method.

For example:
{{{
"#{user.print}"
}}}

defines a method expression that allows to invoke a `print` operation on the
`user` bean.

= Bean Declaration =

The bean type must implement the `Method_Bean` interface.

{{{
with EL.Beans;
with EL.Beans.Methods;
...
type Person is new EL.Beans.Bean and EL.Beans.Methods.Method_Bean with private;
...
overriding
function Get_Method_Bindings (From : in Person)
                              return EL.Beans.Methods.Method_Binding_Array_Access;
}}}



= Create the Method Expression


{{{
Method : EL.Expressions.Method_Expression;
..
Method := EL.Expressions.Create_Expression ("#{user.print}", Ctx);
}}}
